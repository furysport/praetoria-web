                During this phase we&apos;ll start using the logic module and upload smart contracts
                implementing the protocol, the related transaction messages will have a certain gas

                cost. Regarding your validation role, you have at your disposal elements allowing
                you to judge this relevance.

              <p>
                Send us a study highlighting gas consumption relevancy in relation with elements at
                your disposal (e.g. Memory and CPU usage). Argued with curated data from your
                running Node, provide us feedback and suggestions to help us ensuring a fair cost.
